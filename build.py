"""Build index.html from legs.csv, reference.json, orders.json and viewer/.

Three files, split by how often they change rather than by what they describe:

    legs.csv        THE schedule. One row per leg of a journey. Pulled from the
                    Google Sheet named in reference.json when that is reachable,
                    and committed either way so the diff shows what changed and
                    the page has something to draw with no network.

                    The built page reads the sheet itself on every load, so a
                    schedule edit needs no build -- a refresh is enough. This
                    snapshot is the fallback, and running the build is how it
                    gets caught up.
    reference.json  Quasi-static and hand-edited: what a journey is, who is open
                    when, which boat goes where. Months between edits.
    orders.json     Pulled, not typed. Cases and pounds on order by destination,
                    and the pack line's case counts, copied out of the freight
                    model's data.json. Refresh it there, not here.

    python3 build.py

Reads the sheet over the network; needs no credentials.

# own places are in `sites` below and carry no window at all, because the

# absence of a row here, not a value in it, that turns the gating off.
